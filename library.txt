Description: “A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!”—The New York Times Cat’s Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat’s Cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and Vonnegut at his very best. “[Vonnegut is] an unimitative and inimitable social satirist.”—Harper’s Magazine “Our finest black-humorist . . . We laugh in self-defense.”—Atlantic Monthly

Detective Renée Ballard is given the chance of a lifetime: revive the LAPD's cold case unit and find justice for the families of the forgotten. The only catch is they must first crack the unsolved murder of the sister of the city councilman who is sponsoring the department - or lose everything... OTHERS YOU CAN'T FORGIVE. Harry Bosch is top of the list of investigators Ballard wants to recruit. The former homicide detective is a living legend - but for how long? Because Bosch has his own agenda: a crime that has haunted him for years - the murder of a whole family, buried out in the desert - which he vowed to close. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU KNEW WHO DID IT? With the killer still out there and evidence elusive - Bosch is on a collision course with a choice he hoped never to make... * * * * * CRIME DOESN'T COME BETTER THAN CONNELLY: 'The pre-eminent detective novelist of his generation' IAN RANKIN 'The best mystery writer in the world' GQ 'One of the greatest crime writers' DAILY MAIL 'A superb natural storyteller' LEE CHILD 'A master' STEPHEN KING 'A genius' INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY 'Crime thriller writing of the highest order' GUARDIAN 'A terrific writer with pace, style and humanity to spare' THE TIMES 'America's greatest living crime writer' DAILY EXPRESS 'One of the great storytellers of crime fiction' SUNDAY TELEGRAPH
